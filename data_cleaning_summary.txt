Data cleaning with Python is the process of identifying and correcting corrupt, incorrect, or unnecessary data in a data set before analysis. It involves tasks such as detecting outliers, checking for duplicates, and normalizing casing. Python, along with its libraries Numpy and Pandas, is commonly used for data cleaning, preparation, and analysis. The goal of data cleaning is to ensure that downstream processes receive clean data, which is crucial for obtaining accurate and valuable insights.
