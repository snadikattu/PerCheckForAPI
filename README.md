API, or Application Programming Interface, is a contract between different software components on how they should interact. With over 15 years of experience as an API developer, understanding what goes into APIs and how they connect to a framework or an application is critical.

At its core, an API consists of the following elements:

1. **Resources**: These are the entities or objects that the API can return or act upon. For example, in a REST API for a blog, resources could be users, posts, and comments.

2. **Endpoints**: The URLs or URIs that an API exposes for access are known as endpoints. Each endpoint corresponds to a specific resource or a collection of resources.

3. **Methods**: APIs support various methods (also known as verbs) to interact with resources. The most common ones are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

4. **Request and Response Formats**: APIs can support various data formats, with JSON and XML being the most common. The API documentation should clearly specify the request and response formats.

5. **Error Handling**: A good API includes robust error handling and clear error messages to help developers troubleshoot issues.

6. **Authentication and Authorization**: APIs often include mechanisms to identify and authenticate users and to ensure they have the correct permissions to access or modify resources.

7. **Rate Limiting**: To protect the API server from being overwhelmed, APIs often include rate limiting.

Now, let's illustrate these concepts with a simple example using Flask, a popular Python framework for developing APIs.

In this example, we're creating a simple API for managing users. We have endpoints for getting a list of users (`GET /users/`), getting a specific user (`GET /users/<user_id>`), and creating a new user (`POST /users/`). We're using Flask's `MethodView` to separate the logic for each method into different functions.

This is a very basic example, and a real-world API would include more features like authentication, error handling, and more. But it serves to illustrate the main components of an API and how they connect to a framework.
